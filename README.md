This repository contains the source code for my Bachelor's Thesis in Computer Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

The thesis is titled "Configuration Management for Complex Cloud Operations".

## Usage and building

One can easily read the thesis by visiting the NTNU Open archive [here](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/3076981).

Otherwise, since the thesis is written in LaTeX, one can build it using `latexmk` or use the provided GitHub Actions workflow.
